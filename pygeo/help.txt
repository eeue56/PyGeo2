Mouse Interaction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once a display has entered into a event loop by a call to the pickloop() method, it will respond
to mouse events, allowing interactivity with the construction:

  -  *Left click*: 
    
         - if a pickable point is hit, the point hit will identify itself by enlarging and 
           displaying as in Green
           
         - if no pickable point is hit, all pickable points will respond by flashing larger
           and displaying in Blue

  -  *Left drag*:

         - a picked point is moved in reaction to a drag with the left mouse button down.  

  -  *Right drag*:

         -  the scene will rotate around the camera center in reaction to movement with the 
            right mouse button down
            
  -  *Middle drag, 2 button drag*:

         -  the scene will zoom closer or further in reaction to movement with the middle button, or 
            the left and right buttons simultaneoulsy down.
            
Panel Menu
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, a creation of a display also creates a separate panel that contains option box and menu 
options.  The creation of the panel can be suppressed by including the expression "panel = False" as a keyword
parameter when initializing the display:


- Information output

  The lower level boxes of the panel display state information, as follows, floowing the
  display boxes from left to right:

  -  the "name" of the currently picked point, if a label has been assigned to the point.
  -  the the x,y,z coordinates of the currently selected point
  -  the current on/off state of the Trace option (see menu options, below)
  -  the current on/off state of the Drag option (see menu options, below) 

- Check buttons and radio buttons:

  - **Detail Level**:

    when creating a geometric object (i.e. class instance) there is the option to specify
    a display level using the keyword argument "level=<integer value>", with the level defaulting
    to "1" in the absence of an argument. e.g.:
         
    p1= Point(1,17,-3,level=3) 
         
    sets the point p1 to be visible only when Level 3 is checked in the Detail Level check box
    group
         
    Multiple and non-consecutive levels of display can be selected and deselected.
         
    Assigning an object "level = -1" will assure it to be visible at all display
    levels
         
  - **Drag Constraints**:   

    to allow control movement, pickable points designed to be freely movable in space 
    (FreePoint, zFreePoint) are at any one time constrained to a particular plane or direction
    relative to the display coordinate scheme.  The Drag Constraints radio button option sets
    the constraints on the movement on points picked and dragged.

  - **Reset to initial**:
        
    returns all picked and moved points to their position at initialization, and resets all
    dependant objects to their position based on the points' initial positions.
        
  - **Remove tracings**
        
    remove all loci of points and/or lines created via the "tracing" mechanism. 
        
        
  - **Toggle trace on/off**
        
    toggle the enablement of tracing from its current on/off state as diplayed
    in the information text box.
        
  - **Toggle axis visibility**
        
    toggle the visibility of the representation of the 3d coordinates axes.
         
         
  - **Toggle drag effect**
      
    the  drag effect determines whether the construction attempts to update at each
    update cycle during the movement of pickable point ("Drag On") or updates
    only upon release of the dragged point ("Drag Off").
        
    the menu option toggles the state of the drag option form its current state 
    as displayed in the information text box.
        
  - **Animate**
        
    invoke periodic rendering loops, inducing "animation" of objects (and
    their dependents) designed to re-position at each rendering loop cycle.
